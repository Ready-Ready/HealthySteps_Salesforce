# Understanding the Salesforce Architecture

### What Is the Salesforce Architecture?

<p> Salesforce is used to deliver a highly customized experience to your customers, employees, and partners. User can perform task without writing much (or any) code, and can complete it fast. Following are the key points 

- Salesforce is a cloud company. Everything salesforce offer resides in the trusted, multitenant cloud.
- The Salesforce platform is the foundation of all services provided. It's powered by metadata and made up of different parts, like data services, artificial intelligence, and robust APIs for development.
- All our apps sit on top of the platform. Salesforce has prebuilt offerings like Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud, along with apps you build using the platform, have consistent, powerful functionality.
- Everything is integrated. Salesforce provides platform technologies like Einstein predictive intelligence and the Lightning framework for development are built into everything we offer and everything you build. </p>

### Why Trust the cloud?

<p> At Salesforce, trust is our top priority. Not only is the data kept in your org sensitive, but also building functionality that is vital to your company's success on the platform. It's salesforce responsibility to keep your data and functionality safe is not something salesforce takes it lightly, which is why there is always transparent about the services. </p>

<p> Salesforce trust site, trust.salesforce.com, is a vital resource. You can use it to view performance data and get more information about how salesforce secures your data. It also shows you any planned maintenance which salesforce will be performing that might impact your access to Salesforce. </p>

### Sharing Is Caring in the Multitenant Cloud

 <p> Multitenancy is that you are sharing resources. Salesforce provides a core set of services to all the customers in the multitenant cloud. No matter the size of your business, you get access to the same computing power, data storage, and core features.</p>

<p> Trust and multitenancy go hand in hand. Despite the fact that you are sharing space with other companies, you can trust Salesforce to keep your data secure. You can also trust that you are getting the latest and greatest features with automatic, seamless upgrades three times a year. Since Salesforce is a cloud service, you never have to install new features or worry about your hardware. All this is possible because of multitenancy. </p>

### Metadata

Metadata is data about data. It is basically the structure of the Salesforce org. Let's think about an object like Property. When our friends at DreamHouse use Salesforce, they input and view data about properties. For example, a property can be located in Boston, cost $500,000, and have 3 bedrooms.

Now, imagine you stripped away all that specific data. What are you left with? You are left with the Property object along with all its fields, like address, price, and number of bedrooms. You can also have page layouts, security settings, and any other customizations that you have made.

All of these standard and custom configurations, functionality, and code in your org are metadata. Part of the reason you can move so fast on the platform is that Salesforce knows how to store and serve you that metadata immediately after you create it.

### API

API allows different pieces of software to connect to each other and exchange information. With API's you can connect your apps with other apps or software systems without knowing other details, the underlying technology takes care of the specifics of how the information is passed through the system.When a custom object or field is added, the platform automatically creates an API name to retrieve the metadata and data user needs.

For example, we can use a contact's Name field in a bunch of places, like the Salesforce mobile app, a custom page, or even an email template. That's all possible because of the API name.

The core of the API's power is that all of your data and metadata is API enabled. The API gives Salesforce a huge amount of flexibility. It lets to move beyond the normal idea of business software and build unique and creative solutions for your company.Every time you use Salesforce, whether you are using standard functionality or building a custom app, youâ€™re interacting with the API.
