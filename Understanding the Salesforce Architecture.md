# Understanding the Salesforce Architecture

### What Is the Salesforce Architecture?

Salesforce is used to deliver a highly customized experience to your customers, employees, and partners. User can perform task without writing much (or any) code, and can complete it fast. Following are the key points 

- Salesforce is a cloud company. Everything salesforce offer resides in the trusted, multitenant cloud.
- The Salesforce platform is the foundation of all services provided. It's powered by metadata and made up of different parts, like data services, artificial intelligence, and robust APIs for development.
- All our apps sit on top of the platform. Salesforce prebuilt offerings like Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud, along with apps you build using the platform, have consistent, powerful functionality.
- Everything is integrated. Salesforce platform technologies like Einstein predictive intelligence and the Lightning framework for development are built into everything we offer and everything you build
